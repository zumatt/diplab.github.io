# DiPLab - Digital Petri Laboratory



DiPLab is a project that is part of [MAKEAWARE!](https://spearhead-amr.github.io/makeaware/) , which aims to raise awareness about the issue of [Antibiotic Resistance](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antibiotic-resistance).

By digitizing the [antibiogram test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_sensitivity_testing), it is now possible to experience it outside of microbiology laboratories. This workshop provides an exciting opportunity for participants to deepen their understanding of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance. Additionally, participants will have the chance to engage in practical activities and learn about the test in a hands-on setting. This comprehensive workshop aims to help participants gain a deeper appreciation for the significance of antibiotics and their impact on daily life. By attending this workshop, participants will be able to broaden their knowledge of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance and explore the role of these life-saving drugs in modern medicine.

This repository contains the stable version of the DiPLab. In order to create your own digital petri you can download the source code and the 3D files from the releases.

The project has started as a personal thesis project developed during the [SUPSI Master of Arts in Interaction Design](https://maind.supsi.ch).

## Bugs & Issues

If you want to report an issue, you can submit it to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/zumatt/diplab/issues) of this repository.

## Repository info

Inside the main branch you will find the stable version of DiPLab. However, if you want to create your own digital petri is suggested to download the [latest release](https://github.com/zumatt/diplab/releases) and follow the tutorial that you can find here below.
The main branch is divided into hardware and software. In the hardware you will find the 3D files used to create the external case of the DiPLab. In the software folder you will find anything connected to the digital development of the digital petri, here inside you can find the Arduino source code and the application source code.

## Installation tutorial

In order to create your own digital petri you need to be aware on how to use a 3D Printer and have basic knowledge of Arduino and coding.
The tutorial will be developed soon...
